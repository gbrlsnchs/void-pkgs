# My custom Void packages
[![GitLab CI
Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gbrlsnchs/void-pkgs/badges/trunk/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/gbrlsnchs/void-pkgs/-/commits/trunk)

## About
This repository holds custom templates I have written for my personal use. They're picked by GitLab
CI and transformed into binary packages, which are hosted at https://void.gsr.dev.

## How to use
Here is an example of how to use the custom repository:
```console
# xbps-install --repository https://void.gsr.dev/glibc efm-langserver
```

Have fun!
